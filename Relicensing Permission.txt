Aw crap -- it went in spam.  Sorry about that.  GPL is generally OK with
me but I know some people get all huffy about it because of the required
access to source code.  I see both sides of freedom there -- guaranteeing
the freedom to peek at the insides and make mods or borrow code is one
thing, but giving developers the freedom to roll the code into their own
project w/o having to divulge their own source code is another, and they're
kind of at odds (each side thinks the other is missing the point).  But
this doesn't seem like the kind of thing that someone would really want
to stick into a closed-source project anyway, so sure, GPL sounds fine.
I'm about to go away for the weekend, but I'll look at updating what's
on dbit.com (man it's *so old* now!  I think there's even still code in
it from when my easiest access to magtapes was through the neighborhood
IBM mainframe) to GPL when I get abck.
