ITSTAR V1.10				by John Wilson <wilson@dbit.com>

ITSTAR is a program that allows manipulation of DUMP tapes for the ITS
operating system, on UNIX (-like) systems.  Its main purpose is to allow
transferring files from the AI/MC snapshots to a real KS10.  The command
syntax is a subset of UNIX "tar" syntax:

itstar switches [file1 file2 file3...]

Switches:

Exactly one of the following is always required:
 -c	create a DUMP archive
 -r	append to an existing DUMP archive
 -t	type out a list of files in the archive
 -x	extract files from the archive

The following additional switches may be added:
 -v	verify (i.e. list on STDOUT) each file's name as it is processed
 -fname	use "name" as the filename for the tape (drive), one of the following:
	/dev/xxx	A real local tape drive (must start with "/dev/").
	[user@]host:dev	A real remote tape drive, using the "rmt" protocol.
	file		A tape image file (format defined below).
	-		STDIN or STDOUT (format same as for files).
 -h	help (print a list of these switches)

For create/append operations, the rest of the command line is a list of
files to be written to tape.  If a directory name is given, all files
in that directory will be archived using their actual file information
(i.e. dates and link names) unless the directory contains a DIR.LIST file,
in which case information is taken from that file.  Files ending in .Z are
automatically decompressed (in place) before being saved.

Eventually it will be possible to specify a list of files to extract (for
extract operations) but for now it extracts the whole tape.

Conversions:  ITSTAR converts between Alan Bawden's evacuated file format
(used in the AI/MC snapshots) and the format used by the TM03 tape formatter
to store 36-bit words.  Filenames are also translated according to the same
AI/MC rules, and are extracted from the UNIX filenames as follows:

-UNIX-					-ITS-
dir1/dir2/.../dirn/file.ext		DIRN;FILE EXT

Missing filename elements are defaulted to "UFD;FN1 FN2" which are very
unlikely to be right so you should arrange for your filenames to include
all three elements.  For example if you're in directory "foo" and you want
to write out all files named "bar", you should say "itstar c ../foo/bar.*"
rather than just "itstar c bar.*".

Tape image file format:  UNIX tries to make everything look like a stream
of bytes, which is a shame because tapes have intrinsic record structure.
Most UNIX software solves this mismatch by ignoring it (record lengths are
fixed and tape marks are unheard of) but DUMP tapes must have a particular
record structure which must be preserved in the image file.  So the file
consists of a series of records and tape marks, stored like this:

Tape record:
	.long	length		;32-bit record length, PDP-11 byte order
	.blkb	length		;the data for the record
	.even			;*** CHANGE IN ITSTAR V1.10 ***
	.long	length		;length again (for backspacing)

Tape mark:
	.long	0		;only once, since it's the same backwards

This format is compatible with the "SIMH" PDP-10 emulator, and close to
to that used by the Ersatz-11 PDP-11 emulator (can be changed to exactly
the E11 format by setting the "simh" variable in tapeio.c to zero), for
what that's worth.  Contact the author for a utility to transfer between
real tapes and image files under DOS/ASPI (you can't be picky when you're
looking for a machine with a 9-track drive on it these days!).
